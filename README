HOW TO INSTALL

Note: These set of instructions assume that you are running Debian (Lenny). 
It might also work for other systems as well.
It is also assumed that you have sql server installed.


1) changing sources.list temporarily:
	create a backup of source.list:
	cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
	rm /etc/apt/sources.list
	echo "deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main" > /etc/apt/sources.list

2) update apt-get:
	sudo apt-get update

3) install tornado, sqlalchemy, simplejson:
	sudo apt-get install python python-tornado python-sqlalchemy python-simplejson

4) undo changes in source.list which we did in step 1:
	rm /etc/apt/sources.list
	cp /etc/apt/sources.list.backup /etc/apt/sources.list
	rm /etc/apt/sources.list.backup

5) update apt-get:
	sudo apt-get update

Please don't skip step 4 and 5 as it will update other installed binaries which may harm other servers running on machine.
