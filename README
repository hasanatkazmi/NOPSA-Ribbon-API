HOW TO INSTALL

Note: These set of instructions assume that you are running Debian (Lenny). 
It might also work for other systems as well.
It is also assumed that you have sql server installed.


1) changing sources.list temporarily:
	create a backup of source.list:
	cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
	rm /etc/apt/sources.list
	echo "deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main" > /etc/apt/sources.list

2) update apt-get:
	sudo apt-get update

3) install tornado, sqlalchemy, simplejson:
	sudo apt-get install python python-tornado python-sqlalchemy python-simplejson

4) undo changes in source.list which we did in step 1:
	rm /etc/apt/sources.list
	cp /etc/apt/sources.list.backup /etc/apt/sources.list
	rm /etc/apt/sources.list.backup

5) update apt-get:
	sudo apt-get update

Please don't skip step 4 and 5 as it will update other installed binaries which may harm other servers running on machine.


6) now tornado is installed but tornado version is 1.0.1 (we need atleast 1.2.1) and doesn't support all features are used in ribbon API.
	So lets manually update tornado.
	(we installed old tornado at first place so that all depedences can be installed):
	wget -O tornado.tar.gz https://github.com/downloads/facebook/tornado/tornado-1.2.1.tar.gz
	tar -xvvf tornado.tar.gz
	cd tornado-1.2.1
	python setup.py install

7) run tornado tests to confirm install:
	cd tornado/test
	python runtests.py

	confirm that all tests run successfully

8) download the server code:
	(cd into the directory you want server code to reside)
	wget -O ribbon.tar.gz https://github.com/hasanatkazmi/NOPSA-Ribbon-API/tarball/master
	tar -xvvf ribbon.tar.gz
	cd hasanatkazmi*
	python2.6 tornado.py


By now server must be up and running. Visit http://localhost:8000 in a web browswer

DEBUG:
	1 ) 	Confirm database connectivity string in line # 60 of db.py
		(https://github.com/hasanatkazmi/NOPSA-Ribbon-API/blob/ff961a0c8a7fb537c57d420beb33f94503ce72d1/db.py#L69)
	2)	Confirm that line 137 of web/demp.htm conforms to the exact server address
